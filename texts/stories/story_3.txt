Ɛnnora m’adamfo bi kaa anwanwasɛm bi kyerɛɛ me. Ansa na m’adamfo yi bɛfiri ne nsɛnkaeɛ yi ase no, ɔsii so dua sɛ deɛ ɔrebɛka no yɛ asɛm turodoo a ɛsiiɛ wɔ Kumase, borɔno bi a wɔfrɛ no Asokwa. Sɛ wowɔ berɛ a, dom me simma kakraa bi na me ne wo nkyɛ saa asɛm yi.

Yesterday a friend of mine told me a surprising story. Before he began, he made it clear that what he was about to tell me was a true story that happened in Kumasi, specifically in a suburb called Asokwa. If you have time, spare me a few minutes as I share the story with you.

Ɔse, berɛ a na ɔsua no, na aberanteɛ bi wɔ wɔn mpɔtam a na, sɛbe, n’adwene mu ka no kakra. Ɔse na edin a wɔn nyinaa de frɛ saa bɔdamni yi ne ‘Marlay’. Na sɛ bɔdamni no din a ɔmaame de too no ara ne ‘Marlay’ no o, sɛ wɔn a na wɔte mpɔtam hɔ no na wɔde saa din no too no o, na obiara nnim.

He said, when he was little, there was a young man in their community who, excuse my language, was mentally derailed. He said the name that everyone used to call this man was ‘Marlay’. As to whether the name ‘Marlay’ was given to this man by his mum or the people who lived in the community, nobody knew.

Na Marlay yɛ nipa bi a wafɔn yie. Nanso ne fɔn nyinaa akyi no, da biara a wɔbɛhyia no no, na wayɛ sɛ nipa kɛseɛ. Bisa me sɛ deɛn nti.

Marlay was very skinny. However, beyond his skinniness, he always appeared to be a big/fat person whenever they met him. Ask me why.

Ansa na mɛyi w’ano no, ma memmisa wo asɛm bi. M’adamfo no a ɔkaa asɛm yi kyerɛɛ me no susu sɛ mpɛn pii no, nnipa a wɔn adwene mu ka wɔn no fa nnwuma akɛseɛ ahodoɔ toto wɔn ho so. Wo ne m’adamfo yi yɛ adwene anaa?

Before I answer you, let me ask you a question myself. The friend who told me the story believes that, quite often, people who are mentally challenged assign themselves various herculean tasks. Do you agree with him?

Wo deɛ yɛntoa asɛm no so. Marlay adwuma a na wafa ato ne ho so ne sɛ ɔbɛkyini da biara na wasesa wɔn a wɔtete mpɔtam hɔ no ntadeɛ ahyehyɛ. Akokɔ bɔnn kokrokoo ara pɛ, na Marlay asim. Ahemadakye saa nso deɛ, na nnipa pii no ara adeda a wɔrehwa nkorɔmo. Marlay de n’adagya ne ne ho feaa saa ara bɛkyini afie afie mu kɔpem sɛ ɔbɛnya atadeɛ a ɛdi kan ahyɛ. Ɔnya bi hyɛ a na ɛnkyerɛ sɛ wawie o. Ɔkɔ so ara sesa afoforɔ deɛ hyehyɛ gu deɛ ɔhyehyɛ dada no so. Ntadeɛ no nso deɛ, ɔnsam. Mmarima ntadeɛ o, mmaa ntadeɛ o, Marlay bɛhyɛ. Sɛbe mmaa pieto mpo, na Marlay hyɛ.

You let’s continue our story. Marlay’s task that he had assigned himself was to roam about each day, pick dresses of the suburb’s inhabitants, and wear them all. Marlay sets off each dawn as soon as the cock crows. Being that early, many people would’ve slept, snoring away. In stark nakedness and with his skinny body, Marlay will move from house to house till he gets his first dress to put on. And getting one didn’t mean he was done. He’ll continue picking other dresses and wear them over the ones he already had on. As for the types of clothes/dresses, he had no preference. Whether they were gents’ or ladies’ wear, Marlay will wear them. Excuse me to say even ladies’ panties, Marlay used to wear them.

Nti sɛ wobisaa me deɛ nti a na Marlay afɔn nso na wɔbɛhyia no biara na wayɛ sɛ nipa kɛseɛ a, mmuaeɛ no ara ne no. Sɛ Marlay ayɛ kɛseɛ a, na ɛnyɛ sɛ ne ho na atɔ no anaasɛ didi na wadidi amen, na mmom nkorɔfoɔ ntadeɛ nko ara na wawiawia ahyehyɛ ayɛ pafuu de nam Asokwa abɔnten so.

So, if you asked me why Marlay was skinny and yet appeared big whenever they met him, that’s just the answer. If Marlay appeared big on sight, it was neither a sign of good living nor an indication that he had had enough food to eat. It was simply people’s many dresses that he had stolen and worn that had turned him into that big dude strolling the streets of Asokwa.

Ɛberɛ nti, mede bɛsi ha nnɛ. Sɛ wopɛ ntoasoɔ no a, wo deɛ hyia me ha Wukuada.

Because of time, I’ll end it here today. If you want the continuation, you meet me here on Wednesday.

Mema mo nyinaa aha!

Good afternoon to you all.
